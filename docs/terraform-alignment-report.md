# Terraform & Workflow Alignment Report (A-01)

## Summary of Changes
- Expanded `infra/agent-variables.tf` to include the standardized Terraform Cloud variable set for Docker Hub, global infrastructure, GitHub automation, and Notion integrations.
- Added `infra/variables.tfvars` to document workspace variables that Terraform Cloud injects during remote runs.
- Updated `.github/workflows/tfc-sync.yml` so Terraform commands run from `./infra`, matching the repository layout and Terraform Cloud expectations.
- Refreshed `.github/workflows/verify-env-vars.yml` with the current environment variable inventory, including Terraform Cloud and GitHub secrets required by the agent.
- Authored `docs/terraform-alignment-plan.md` (implementation blueprint) and this report to capture validation status.

## Validation
1. Verified Terraform files live exclusively under `infra/` using repository search.
2. Confirmed no sensitive default values exist in `.tf` files; all secrets remain unset and sourced from Terraform Cloud.
3. Executed `terraform fmt` inside `infra/` to normalize formatting, then attempted `terraform init`/`terraform validate` with placeholder credentials. The commands failed to download the `integrations/github` provider because outbound network access to `registry.terraform.io` is blocked in the build container (see command log).
4. Prepared to trigger the `tfc-sync / terraform` workflow after merge to produce a Terraform Cloud plan/apply run with the standardized variables.

## Command Log
```
cd infra
TF_VAR_AGENT_ACTIONS=test-token terraform fmt
TF_VAR_AGENT_ACTIONS=test-token terraform init -backend=false
TF_VAR_AGENT_ACTIONS=test-token terraform validate
```

> `terraform init` / `terraform validate` failed with `Failed to query available provider packages` because the registry could not be reached from the container. The configuration remains syntactically valid, and Terraform Cloud will supply the provider during remote runs.

## Next Steps
- Trigger `tfc-sync / terraform` workflow once changes are merged to confirm Terraform Cloud consumes the configuration without missing variable errors.
- Monitor the workflow output for successful `init`, `plan`, and (if applicable) `apply` phases.
