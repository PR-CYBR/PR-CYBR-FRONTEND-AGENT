The documentation set now includes Mermaid diagrams that capture how this repository is organized and how it coordinates with the broader PR-CYBR agent network. Open the diagrams with any Mermaid-compatible previewer (e.g., VS Code's Mermaid extension or the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)) to interact with them.
